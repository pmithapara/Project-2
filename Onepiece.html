  <h3><strong>About One Piece</strong></h3>
    <p>One Piece is a japanese based manga series which is later on converted into an anime. This series is written and drawn by Eiichiro Oda and it started back in July 22, 1997 till present. This is, accoriding to my knowledge, one of the best and the longest anime which had been delivering good contant without stopping for so many years. So far, there are more than 900 chapters into this story. This manga is about a ship crew (Nakama in japanese), who are sailing out to the sea to conquer the world.</p>

  <h2><strong>Authors note</strong></h2>
			    
  <p>Eiichiro Oda is a very passionate manga artist who started to show interest in cartoons at the age of four. He started writting mangas in order to avoid having a real job. One is not just an anime, it's much more than that; it shows the true meaning of friendship. Zoro is one of the most inspiring character in the whole series, no matter what the situation there are in, he will alway look after his friends and protect them from any outside threats.</p>
